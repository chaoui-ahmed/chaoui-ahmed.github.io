## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pygame not found**
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install pygame
   \`\`\`

2. **Game runs slowly**
   - Close other applications
   - Reduce particle count in `add_stars_background()`

3. **Font issues**
   - The game uses system fonts as fallback
   - Install additional fonts if needed

### Performance Tips
- Run on systems with dedicated graphics for best performance
- Ensure Python 3.7+ for optimal compatibility
- Close unnecessary background applications
