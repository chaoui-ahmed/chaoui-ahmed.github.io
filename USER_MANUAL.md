**Objective:** Control more territory than your opponent when the board is full.

**Basic Rules:**
1. Players take turns placing pieces on the 8x8 board
2. You must "capture" opponent pieces by flanking them
3. Captured pieces flip to your color
4. If you can't make a valid move, your turn is skipped
5. Game ends when the board is full or no moves are possible

**Valid Moves:**
- Place your piece adjacent to an opponent's piece
- Your piece must "sandwich" opponent pieces in a straight line
- All sandwiched pieces flip to your color

### Sliding Puzzle Rules (Training Academy)
Arrange numbered tiles in sequential order.

**Objective:** Arrange tiles from 1 to N in order, with the empty space in the bottom-right.

**How to Play:**
1. Click tiles adjacent to the empty space to move them
2. Use the empty space to maneuver tiles into position
